The sun was shining brightly in the sky, and the sky looked clear and blue. Birds were flying across the sky, enjoying the warm sunlight. As I walked under the sky, I felt a cool breeze, and the breeze made the leaves rustle gently. The breeze carried the scent of flowers, and the flowers swayed with the breeze. It was a peaceful morning, and the morning air felt fresh and crisp.
